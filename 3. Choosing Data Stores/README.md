# Choosing Data Stores

Selecting the right data store is a critical decision in data engineering. Different types of data require different storage solutions, and each comes with trade-offs in performance, scalability, and complexity.

## Data Stores Basics

Before choosing a data store, itâ€™s essential to understand key concepts like **OLTP vs. OLAP**, **ETL vs. ELT**, and how to rank data stores.

### OLTP vs. OLAP

| Feature           | OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) | OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Handles transactional operations   | Handles analytical queries          |
| **Data Type**     | Operational, real-time data        | Historical, aggregated data         |
| **Operations**    | Frequent, simple read/write        | Complex queries, aggregations       |
| **Example Use Cases** | Banking, e-commerce apps         | BI reporting, analytics             |
| **Storage Example**   | MySQL, PostgreSQL                 | Snowflake, Google BigQuery           |


### ETL vs. ELT

| Process    | ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)           | ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)        |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Process Flow** | Data transformed before loading      | Data loaded first, then transformed   |
| **Speed**   | Slower due to early transformation      | Faster, leverages modern storage power |
| **Best For**| Traditional databases, structured data | Big data environments, cloud storage  |
| **Examples**| Informatica, Talend                     | Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift         |


### Data Stores Ranking Criteria

When choosing a data store, consider the following factors:

1. **Data Structure:** Structured, semi-structured, or unstructured?
2. **Scalability:** How well does it handle growth?
3. **Latency Requirements:** Real-time vs. batch processing.
4. **Cost Efficiency:** Cloud vs. on-premise costs.
5. **Query Complexity:** Simple CRUD operations vs. complex analytics.
6. **Consistency vs. Availability:** CAP theorem trade-offs.


## Relational Databases

Relational databases (RDBMS) store data in structured tables with relationships between them. They are ideal for transactional applications where consistency is crucial.

### How to Choose a Relational Database?

Ask yourself:

- **Do you need strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees?**
- **How complex are your relationships?**
- **What is the expected volume of data?**

### Popular Relational Databases

| Database      | Description                         | Use Cases                |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| MySQL         | Open-source, widely used           | Web applications, e-commerce |
| PostgreSQL    | Advanced features, complex queries | Financial systems, analytics |
| SQL Server    | Microsoft ecosystem                | Enterprise applications   |
| Oracle DB     | High performance, enterprise focus | Large-scale enterprise workloads |



## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are designed for scalability and flexibility, handling semi-structured or unstructured data. They are suitable for modern applications requiring rapid scalability.

### NoSQL Basics

| Feature         | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema**       | Flexible, no fixed schema                         |
| **Scalability**  | Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)           |
| **Consistency**  | Typically eventual consistency                     |
| **Data Model**   | Key-value, document, column, graph                  |


### Types of NoSQL Databases

1. **Document Stores**
   - Store JSON-like documents.
   - Ideal for flexible, hierarchical data.
   - **Examples:** MongoDB, CouchDB.

2. **Time Series Databases**
   - Optimized for timestamped data.
   - Ideal for IoT, monitoring applications.
   - **Examples:** InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.

3. **Search Engines**
   - Designed for fast text-based searches.
   - Ideal for log analysis, full-text search.
   - **Examples:** Elasticsearch, Solr.

4. **Wide Column Stores**
   - Store data in columns rather than rows.
   - Ideal for large-scale analytical workloads.
   - **Examples:** Apache Cassandra, HBase.

5. **Key-Value Stores**
   - Simple key-value pairs, very fast lookups.
   - Ideal for caching and session storage.
   - **Examples:** Redis, DynamoDB.

6. **Graph Databases**
   - Designed for relationships between entities.
   - Ideal for social networks, fraud detection.
   - **Examples:** Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

## Data Warehouses & Data Lakes

When dealing with analytical workloads, data warehouses and data lakes are essential.

### Data Warehouses

A **data warehouse** is a structured repository optimized for fast querying and reporting.

| Feature         | Description                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema**       | Predefined schema                               |
| **Performance**  | Optimized for complex queries                   |
| **Best For**     | Business intelligence, structured data          |
| **Examples**     | Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery      |


### Data Lakes

A **data lake** stores raw data in its native format, structured or unstructured, for future analysis.

| Feature         | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
