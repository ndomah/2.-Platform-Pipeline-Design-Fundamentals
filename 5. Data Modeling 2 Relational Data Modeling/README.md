# Data Modeling 2 Relational Data Modeling

## Introduction
From DAMA International:
- A *model* is an abstract representation of how something is built or how it works.
- *Data modeling* is the process of discovering, analyzing, and scoping data requirements, and then representing and communicating these data requirements in a precise form called the *data model*.
- Each model contains *a set of components*. Some examples of components are entities, relationships, facts, keys, and attributes.
