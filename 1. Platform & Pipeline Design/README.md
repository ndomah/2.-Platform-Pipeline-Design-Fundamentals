# Platform & Pipeline Basics

## The Platform Blueprint

![platform blueprint](https://github.com/ndomah/2.-Platform-Pipeline-Design-Fundamentals/blob/main/1.%20Platform%20%26%20Pipeline%20Design/img/fig1%20-%20data%20platfrom%20blueprint.png)

The **Data Platform Blueprint** in the image represents the core components of a modern data engineering pipeline. It outlines how data flows from external and internal sources, is processed, stored, and finally visualized for business insights:

**Connect (Data Ingestion)**: This stage involves collecting data from various sources, both internal and external, to bring it into the data platform.
-	Internal sources:
    -	**APIs** – Systems expose APIs that provide structured data (e.g., REST, GraphQL).
    -	**Data Integration Tools** – ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as Apache Nifi, Talend, or Fivetran to automate data ingestion.
-	External sources:
    -	**APIs** – External systems such as third-party services or public data sources.
    -	**Warehouses & SQL DBs** – Pre-existing databases from other systems.
  
**Store (Data Storage)**: Once ingested, data must be stored efficiently for processing and analytics.
-	**SQL & NoSQL Databases** – Traditional relational (SQL) databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL for structured data; NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra for semi-structured/unstructured data.
-	**Data Lakes** store raw data in its native format, commonly used with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake).
-	**Data Warehouses** (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) store structured and processed data optimized for querying and analytics.

**Buffer (Data Staging)**: Buffering ensures that data is temporarily stored and processed asynchronously before final processing.
-	**Message Queues** – Tools like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and AWS SQS that handle event-driven data flows and real-time streaming.
-	**Caches** – Fast data retrieval via in-memory solutions such as Redis and Memcached for quick lookups.

**Process (Data Processing)**: Data processing refers to transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analytics and reporting.
-	**Stream Processing** – Real-time data processing frameworks such as Apache Flink, Spark Streaming, and Apache Kafka Streams for continuous data processing.
-	**Batch Processing** – Scheduled processing of large data sets using tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, or traditional ETL pipelines.

**Visualize (Data Analytics & Reporting)**: The final stage involves making processed data available for business users through visualization and reporting tools.
-	**Web UIs** – Custom-built dashboards and reporting portals.
-	**BI Tools** – Tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker for in-depth analysis.
-	**Mobile Apps** – Providing insights to end users via mobile-friendly applications.

**Data Ingestion**
-	Collect raw data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files (CSV, JSON), or streaming platforms.
-	Tools: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Airbyte, custom scripts.

**Data Storage**
-	Store the ingested raw data in a data lake (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) or a staging database.
-	Tools: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, HDFS, PostgreSQL.

**Data Processing (ETL/ELT)**
-	Transform raw data into a usable format by cleaning, aggregating, and joining datasets.
-	Can be batch processing (daily, hourly) or real-time processing (streaming).
-	Tools: Apache Spark, dbt, SQL, Apache Beam.

**Data Warehousing**
-	Store processed data in a structured format optimized for analytics.
-	Tools: Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift.

**Data Serving**
-	Expose the data for querying and visualization through BI tools or APIs.
-	Tools: Tableau, Power BI, Looker, REST/GraphQL APIs.

**Monitoring & Orchestration**
-	Automate and monitor the pipeline to ensure smooth data flow and alert on failures.
-	Tools: Apache Airflow, Prefect, Dagster.

## Push and Pull Ingestion Pipelines

| Feature              | Push Ingestion Pipeline                        | Pull Ingestion Pipeline                      |
|---------------------: |----------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------- |
|**Pipeline**           |![push](https://github.com/ndomah/2.-Platform-Pipeline-Design-Fundamentals/blob/main/1.%20Platform%20%26%20Pipeline%20Design/img/fig4%20-%20push%20ingestion.png)                                           |![pull](https://github.com/ndomah/2.-Platform-Pipeline-Design-Fundamentals/blob/main/1.%20Platform%20%26%20Pipeline%20Design/img/fig5%20-%20pull%20ingestion.png)                                         |
| **Data Flow Trigger** | Data is pushed automatically by the source system. | Data is fetched actively by the pipeline.    |
| **Initiator**         | Source system initiates the data transfer.     | The pipeline initiates the data transfer.    |
| **Latency**           | Low latency, near real-time data ingestion.    | Higher latency, data ingested at scheduled intervals. |
| **Examples**          | IoT sensors, event-driven logs, webhooks.      | API data extraction, batch database queries. |
| **Common Tools**      | Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub, Webhooks.  | Airbyte, Fivetran, Cron Jobs, REST APIs.     |
